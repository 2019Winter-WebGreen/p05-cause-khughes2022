            <h3>Why Should I Foster A Dog?</h3>
                <p>Dogs multiply daily.  The average litter size is 5 puppies.  There are not nearly enough shelters for these dogs.  Fostering dogs can save their lives and give them a nice, loving home and family until they can receive a permanent one.  Not only can fostering save the dogs' lives, but a dog is a man's best friend!  Dogs are known to comfort those with anxiety, serve as a guide and protection for the blind, relieve stress, and aid those with mental disabilities or disorders.  By fostering, you can save the pooch and also yourself.  </p>

            <h3>The Purpose Of A Dog</h3>
            <p>Dogs have many purposes.  There is even a movie dedicated to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1753383/"> <!-- This is a link to the movie "A Dog/'s Purpose" -->"A Dog's Purpose."</a> From their abiliy to heal a broken heart to their ability to save the world, dogs are hreoes.  No shelter has enough room for every stray that walks in.  And if they do, some shelters abuse the dogs.  By fostering, you can save a dogs life so that it can save others'.  Canines are a special force in the police unit.  Although these canines are vicious attack dogs, they are loyal to their owners and love unconditionally if treated correctly.</p>
